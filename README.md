### Hi there!
One day I'll make a magnificent description, but even right now you can find over there some interesting WIP-stuff:
* PCB files and technical drawings;
* 3D draft model;
* Font and logo candidates;
* ...and some more.

### Some explanations
Idea of making watches by yourself isn't new: 
* [BigTime](https://github.com/sparkfun/BigTime) by Sparkfun (@sparkfun). Interesting project, but, as for me, it isn't tiny and ergonomical (IMHO). 
* [Square Arduino watch](http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/28/a-diy-arduino-watch-thats-actually-wearable-still-wont-win-yo/).
* [3D-printed watch](http://habrahabr.ru/company/masterkit/blog/254099/) by [МастерКит](http://masterkit.ru/) (привет, [Хабр](http://habrahabr.ru/) и [Geektimes](http://geektimes.ru/) :D).
* hundreds of other exciting projects as interesting as these above!

It's dull and stupid to copy any of existing stuff, that's why I decided to design everything by myself. Also I didn't want to add [DS1307 IC](http://www.digibay.in/image/cache/data/sachinelectronics/LS01/LS01-99-0089-A-600x600.jpg) because it's TOO popular and casual. 

### Why ATmega48?
That chip isn't new, but one day I got unused industrial electricity meter with **ATmega48V-10AI**. At one moment I wanted to change **TQFP32** MCU (9x9 mm) to **QFN32** (5x5 mm), however, I had to give up that idea because it's extremely difficult to buy such a chips by one piece.
