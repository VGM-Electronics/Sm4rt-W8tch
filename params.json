{"name":"Sm4rt W8tch","tagline":"I wanted to make my own compact watches. Why not?","body":"### Hi there!\r\nOne day I'll make a magnificent description, but even right now you can find over there some interesting WIP-stuff:\r\n* PCB files and technical drawings;\r\n* 3D draft model;\r\n* Font and logo candidates;\r\n* ...and some more.\r\n\r\n### Some explanations\r\nIdea of making watches by yourself isn't new: \r\n* [BigTime](https://github.com/sparkfun/BigTime) by Sparkfun (@sparkfun). Interesting project, but, as for me, it isn't tiny and ergonomical (IMHO). \r\n* [Square Arduino watch](http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/28/a-diy-arduino-watch-thats-actually-wearable-still-wont-win-yo/).\r\n* [3D-printed watch](http://habrahabr.ru/company/masterkit/blog/254099/) by [МастерКит](http://masterkit.ru/) (привет, [Хабр](http://habrahabr.ru/) и [Geektimes](http://geektimes.ru/) :D).\r\n* hundreds of other exciting projects as interesting as these above!\r\n\r\nIt's dull and stupid to copy any of existing stuff, that's why I decided to design everything by myself. Also I didn't want to add [DS1307 IC](http://www.digibay.in/image/cache/data/sachinelectronics/LS01/LS01-99-0089-A-600x600.jpg) because it's TOO popular and casual. \r\n\r\n### Why ATmega48?\r\nThat chip isn't new, but one day I got unused industrial electricity meter with **ATmega48V-10AI**. At one moment I wanted to change **TQFP32** MCU (9x9 mm) to **QFN32** (5x5 mm), however, I had to give up that idea because it's extremely difficult to buy such a chips by one piece.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
